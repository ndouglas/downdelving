# Downdelving
**Downdelving** is an experimental roguelike written in Rust.  It's built upon the base supplied by [Bracket's Rust Roguelike Tutorial](https://github.com/amethyst/rustrogueliketutorial).  It's a rewrite of [Azymus](https://github.com/ndouglas/azymus), my first experiment in this direction.

At the moment, I'm just running through the Rust roguelike tutorial, since it's now been a couple years since I did anything in Rust.  Watch this space, if you wanna.

You can play the game [in your browser](https://ndouglas.github.io/downdelving/) (assuming your browser supports it).
